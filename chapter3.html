            Some of her posts were her photography, others selfies, but most were photos with her friends. She felt more discouraged the further she scrolled down the page. Sam seemed really happy, and Robin was glad she was, but she couldn’t help feeling a little sad that Sam might’ve forgotten about her.

                    Robin reached for it and realized it was her own bracelet, just like the one Sam wore in the photo.
