            Without a second thought, I entered her name into Google<br>
            and found her Instagram. I nearly jumped out of my chair.<br>

            She seemed really happy, and I was glad she was, but I couldn’t help feeling a little sad that she’d might’ve forgotten about me. I was feeling more and more discouraged the further I scrolled down the page. I pushed back my chair and stepped away from my desk. <br><br>

                    I reached for it and realized it was my own bracelet, just like the one Sam wore in the photo.

                    My courage came flooding back in. I opened the messenger and began typing...
