            <p>Without a second thought, I entered her name into Google and found her Instagram. I nearly jumped out of my chair. I found Sam! Some of her posts were her photography, others selfies, but most were photos with her friends.

            <p>She seemed really happy, and I was glad she was, but I couldn’t help feeling a little sad that she’d might’ve forgotten about me. I was feeling more and more discouraged the further I scrolled down the page. I pushed back my chair and stepped away from my desk. As I paced back and forth, debating whether or not I should message her, I see a familiar *description of MC’s bracelet.* I reached for it and realized it was my own bracelet, just like the one Sam wore in the photo.
