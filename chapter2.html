            <p>I was surprised at how public the teacher kept her profile. I figured she would’ve wanted her personal life hidden from prying students, even if most of her posts were just cat videos, innocent memes only teachers would understand, and stream of consciousness-esque status updates. Lucky me, I thought. Someone so open on Facebook, especially a teacher, would probably have less reservations revealing student information to a complete stranger. I sent her a message and attached the photo of me and Sam to prove that I was genuine. What I was doing could’ve been considered as stalking, but at least she knew it was for good intentions.

            <p>Her message back was professional, yet sprinkled with enough kindness and emojis not to feel cold and distant. She wrote:

                Hello there!

                Unfortunately, I did not have the pleasure of ever having Sam as a student. Her last name and whereabouts are a mystery to me as well. However, I do know she was in the photography club. I always saw her carrying a camera, always taking pictures. In fact, I believe she won a contest for one of them. She’s a super talented girl!

                Best of luck on your search. I hope you two are reunited soon!

            <p>Another dead end. Finding Sam was starting to feel impossible. I stared at the teacher’s message and took a deep breath. Maybe I could find something about the contest or publication—if either even happened—but I doubt the teacher would know its name. So where do I begin?

                I opened another tab and typed “*name of high school* student photography winner” into Google. 94.4 million results in 0.74 seconds. That’s a start.

            <p>I scanned through them, clicking the ones that looked the most promising. On my 30th or so click, I found it. It was an article about Sam: During her senior year, she won a country-wide photography contest and the winning photo was featured in her local gallery.

                And there it was—her last name—printed on the award she clutched close to her chest.

                What is Sam’s last name? _________________
