            I was surprised at how public the teacher kept her profile. <br>
            I figured she would’ve wanted her personal life hidden from students, <br>
            even if most of her posts were just cat videos,<br>
            innocent memes only teachers would understand, <br>
            and stream of consciousness-esque status updates.

            Lucky me, I thought. Someone so open on Facebook, especially a teacher, would probably have less reservations revealing student information to a complete stranger. I sent her a message and attached the photo of me and Sam to prove that I was genuine. What I was doing could’ve been considered as stalking, but at least she knew it was for good intentions.<br><br>
            Her message back was professional, yet sprinkled with enough kindness and emojis not to feel cold and distant. She wrote:<br><br>

            Hello there!

            Unfortunately, I did not have the pleasure of ever having Sam as a student. Her last name and whereabouts are a mystery to me as well. However, I do know she was in the photography club. I always saw her carrying a camera, always taking pictures. In fact, I believe she won a contest for one of them. She’s a super talented girl!

            Best of luck on your search. I hope you two are reunited soon!

        <p>Another dead end. Finding Sam was starting to feel impossible. I stared at the teacher’s message and took a deep breath. Maybe I could find something about the contest or publication—if either even happened—but I doubt the teacher would know its name. So where do I begin?

                I opened another tab and typed “Martin Grove High School student photography winner” into Google. <br><br>
                94.4 million results in 0.74 seconds.
                That’s a start.<br><br>

            I scanned through them, clicking the ones that looked the most promising. On my 30th or so click, I found it. It was an article about Sam: During her senior year, she won a country-wide photography contest and the winning photo was featured in her local gallery.<br><br>

            And there it was—her last name—printed on the award she clutched close to her chest.<br><br>
